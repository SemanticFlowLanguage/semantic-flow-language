How to Contribute

To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow these steps when you want to contribute:
	1.	Fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.
	2.	Create a new branch for your changes:

git checkout -b feature-name


	3.	Make your changes — ensure that your code is clear, well-documented, and follows the existing style.
	4.	Test your changes thoroughly.
	5.	Commit your changes with clear and concise messages:

git commit -m "Add feature/bugfix: Describe the change"


	6.	Push your changes to your fork:

git push origin feature-name


	7.	Create a pull request (PR) to the main repository, providing a clear description of what your changes do and why they’re needed.

We encourage contributors to break their changes into small, manageable PRs. Larger contributions should be discussed before starting work.

Reporting Bugs

If you discover a bug or unexpected behavior in the SFL project, please report it by following these steps:
	1.	Search existing issues: Before creating a new issue, check the Issues￼ page to see if your bug has already been reported.
	2.	Provide details: Include as much detail as possible in the bug report:
	•	A clear description of the problem
	•	Steps to reproduce the issue
	•	Expected vs. actual results
	•	Any relevant error messages or logs

The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to fix the issue.

Submitting Changes

If you want to contribute code, make sure to follow these guidelines:
	•	Follow existing code style: Ensure your code aligns with the project’s existing style and conventions.
	•	Document your changes: If your change is significant, update or add documentation where necessary.
	•	Write tests: If you’re fixing a bug or adding new features, add tests to ensure the new behavior works and won’t break existing functionality.
	•	Link to an issue: If your PR addresses an issue, please mention it in your PR description (e.g., “Closes #12”).
